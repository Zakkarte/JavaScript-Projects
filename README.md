I created a Pizza Menu used to order pizza varying in size, price and topping configurations. It takes all input and calculates total price of the pizza based on input and a predetermined cost sheet

I created a Tic Tac Toe Game where you play the classic game against a very basic computer system

I also created a basic 4 function calculator all from a webpage.
